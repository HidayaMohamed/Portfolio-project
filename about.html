      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <p>
        I am Hidaya Mohamed Mohamud, a high school graduate,
        and i am currently pursuing Software Engineering at Moringa school. My
        curiosity about how technology shapes the world around us sparked my
        interest in programming. I enjoy solving problems, building practical
        solutions, and continuously learning new technical skills. Programming
        excites me because it allows me to turn ideas into real projects while
        sharpening my problem-solving and logical thinking abilities.
